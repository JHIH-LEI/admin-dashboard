This project does not follow the mobile-first principle because the goal of this homework was to practice using CSS Grid and Flexbox. 
The project is based on [this tutorial from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

Here’s a brief overview of my approach:

Initial Layout:
I began by annotating the design image with boxes and comments to help visualize and plan the structure of the HTML.
HTML Structure:
Next, I completed the HTML layout, ensuring the structure matched the design.
Component Layout:
I then worked on laying out the overall components, followed by focusing on each individual component layout. Once all components were positioned, I moved on to refining the typography and other text-related styles.
Fluid Design:
Additionally, I experimented with CSS clamp() for creating a fluid design that adapts to different view points.

Here’s the final result:
